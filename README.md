`coder` is a command line utility for Coder.

To report bugs and request features, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cdr/coder-cli/issues/new).

## Code

Coder CLI is now closed source. The code in this repo will remain as it was when
it was closed sourced in 1.24.0. Issues and releases will continue to be used
for the time being but this may change in the future.

We recommend using the SDK included in this repo until we publish a new Go SDK,
which we are working on right now.
